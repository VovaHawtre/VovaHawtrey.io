The Ultimate Chocolate Chip Cookies
Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups brown sugar
2 tablespoons milk
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 large egg
1 3/4 cups flour
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon baking soda 
AS MANY CHOCOLATE CHIPS AS YOUR HEART DESIRES

	Preheat the oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit. Begin by mixing the brown sugar, milk,
and vanilla extract in a medium bowl on a medium speed with an electric mixer. Beat the egg
in afterwards. Add the flour, salt, and baking soda to the bowl and beat with the electric
mixer on high. Stir in as many chocolate chips as you want. Then, place the cookie dough in 
small globs on two cookie sheets. Heat in the oven 7-9 minutes. It makes about 24 cookies. 
Let them sit (away from cats and dogs) for about 5 minutes. Then, feel free to eat them!
